# TheFishboneProject
A collaborative project aimed at learning why incidents of police violence against black Americans happen and what we can do to prevent further incidents.

The tool used to create the fishbone diagrams in this project is XMind (https://www.xmind.net). The free version has all the features needed to contribute to this project.

Another tool I would recommend downloading is Sourcetree (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com). This application makes the process of project collaboration through git/github easier and more intuitive compared to git's normal command-line interface.
