# The Fishbone Project
A collaborative project aimed at learning why specific incidents of police violence against black Americans happened and what we, as regular citizens, can do to prevent future incidents.

For more details on this project, please see the following document:

## How to Collaborate
### Tools Used
The tool used to create the fishbone diagrams in this project is XMind (https://www.xmind.net). The free version has all the features needed to generate content for this project.

Another tool I would recommend downloading is Sourcetree (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com). This application makes the process of project collaboration through git/github easier and more intuitive compared to git's normal command-line interface.

### How To Collaborate With Git/Github
1. Create a github account

2. Message me with your github username. I will add you as a collaborator.

3. If you want to add a new incident, create a branch off of "publish" with "incident/" pre-appended to your name for the incident (e.g. incident/philandoCastile). In your branch, create a new folder with the name of your incident in the "incidents" sub-folder. The new folder you create is where the XMind document will be stored, along with any associated documents related to the incident.

4. If you want to propose a new solution, create a branch off of "publish" with "solution/" pre-appended to your name for the solution (e.g. solution/defundThePolice). In your branch, create a new folder with the name of your solution in the "solutions" sub-folder. The new folder you create is where the XMind document will be stored, along with any associated documents related to the solution.

5. When you want to publish the contents of your branch for public viewing, create a pull request to merge your branch into "publish" and tag fellow collaborators for review. Approval from a collaborator is required before merging into "publish".

6. When the pull request/review has been approved, and the branch has been merged into "publish", we will share the XMind document to the following gallery: https://www.xmind.net/share/ and link to the published diagram on the google doc linked above.

## Best Practices

### Incidents
The head of the fishbone diagram should contain a brief summary of the incident of police violence. This is a statement of the problem that we are trying to root cause.

Subtopics should either:
1) Answer the question of WHY in regards to the head of the fishbone or a WHY-related parent topic
2) Link to a SOLUTION in the solutions folder that could potentially address a WHY-related parent topic

Try to create as many WHY-related subtopics as possible before linking a subtopic to a solution.

If possible, add a reference to any external documents supporting the claims made in all subtopics. This can be a news article, a publication, a book, etc. The reference should be added as a note attached to the subtopic. If possible, add any related quotes from the document to the note. Any subtopics without an associated reference will be easily identified as an assumption/theory. Assumptions/theories are not discouraged, as they are useful for the brainstorming process. **However, keep in mind that proposing a solution off of an assumption/theory that does not have supporting evidence is less convincing that proposing a solution off of a claim with supporting evidence.**

### Solutions
Use whatever diagram format you think will best convey the solution in a visual manner

List all WHY-related topics from all specific incidents that the solution addresses

Explain BARRIERs to implementing the SOLUTION proposed

Explain actions that a citizen can take to help eliminate the BARRIERs described

If possible, add a reference to any external documents supporting the claims made in your solution diagram.
