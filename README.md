# The Fishbone Project
A collaborative project aimed at learning why incidents of police violence against black Americans happen and what we, as regular citizens, can do to prevent them

## How to Contribute
### Tools Used
The tool used to create the fishbone diagrams in this project is XMind (https://www.xmind.net). The free version has all the features needed to contribute to this project.

Another tool I would recommend downloading is Sourcetree (https://www.sourcetreeapp.com). This application makes the process of project collaboration through git/github easier and more intuitive compared to git's normal command-line interface.

### How To Collaborate With Git/Github
1. Create a github account

2. Message me with your github username. I will add you as a collaborator.

3. If you want to add a new incident, create a branch off of "publish" with "incident/" pre-appended to your name for the incident (e.g. incident/philandoCastile). In your branch, create a new folder with the name of your incident. This new folder is where the XMind document will be stored, along with any associated documents related to the incident.

4. When you want to publish your fishbone diagram for the incident for public viewing, create a pull request to merge your branch into "publish" and tag a fellow collaborator for review. Approval from a collaborator is required before merging into "publish".

5. When the pull request/review has been approved, and the branch has been merged into "publish", we will share the XMind document to the following gallery: https://www.xmind.net/share/ and link to the published diagram on the google doc linked above.

## Best Practices

The head of the fishbone diagram should contain a brief summary of the incident of police violence. This is a statement of the problem that we are trying to root cause.

Subtopics should either:
1) Answer the question of WHY from a WHY-related parent topic or the head of the diagram
2) Propose a SOLUTION to a WHY-related parent topic
3) Explain a BARRIER to implementing the policy proposed in a SOLUTION-related parent topic
4) Propose an action a citizen can take to help eliminate the barrier described in a BARRIER-related parent topic

If possible, add a reference to any external documents supporting the claims made in all subtopics. This can be a news article, a publication, a book, etc. The reference should be added as a note attached to the subtopic. If possible, add any related quotes from the document to the note. Any subtopics without an associated reference will be easily identified as an assumption/theory. Assumptions/theories are not discouraged, as they are useful for the brainstorming process. **However, keep in mind that proposing a solution off of an assumption/theory that does not have supporting evidence is less convincing that proposing a solution off of a claim with supporting evidence.**
